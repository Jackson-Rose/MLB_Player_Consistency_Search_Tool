# MLB_Player_Consistency_Search_Tool
This python script searches through a .csv file and returns the year in which the player's OPS+ (a league-adjusted version of on-base percentage plus slugging) deviated from the previous year's by the smallest amount, followed by the delta between the two.
I wrote this script because I was curious to find instances of players repeating their prior year's performance, and I couldn't find a great source for that information online. 
The project was made with baseball-reference.com in mind - using a different website for data may result in formatting errors. Thanks for reading!
